# Zostay Rakudo

This is a dockerized container for [Rakudo](https://rakudo.org) for use by
myself and some projects I'm working on. I'm working on some projects using
Raspberry Pi, in particular, for which I need Raku, so this being a multi-arch
image is it's unique bit. That and for security concerns, I prefer to control my
docker images where I can.
